# Wallit
Wallit is a simple personal finance app that allows you to keep track of your budget by logging your transactions easily.

Quick Overview:
The amount of money you've spent will show up directly in the middle of the page.
Type in the cost of the current transaction you're trying to log and click enter.
The number will automatically update and your transaction will be logged where it says transactions.
